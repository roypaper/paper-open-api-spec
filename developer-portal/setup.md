# Setup

You can set up your callback URL Setting by reaching our developers team. You need to provide a callback URL endpoint in your system to receive callback from us. 
With the Callback URL the HTTPS connection will be terminated immediately and a unique id will be returned in the response body. PAPER.ID will POST a message to the callback_url specified in your request in a JSON format application/json. The ID in the response will reflect the ID in the results posted to your Callback URL.
