  summary: Updated Purchase Order by id
  description: |
    You can use this API to update existing purchase order that has been created. Updating the purchase order will change the content of the order.

    **IMPORTANT**

    Changing the content of the order wonâ€™t be reflected on your partner until you resend the document once again. It is highly advised to trigger sending new document after the change.
    In addition, changing the supplier will also trigger cancellation of your previous purchase order that has been received by previous supplier.
