  summary: Edit Delivery Order
  description: |
    You can use this API to update existing delivery order that has been created. Updating the delivery order will change the content of the order.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Changing the content of the order wonâ€™t be reflected on your partner until you resend the document once again. It is highly advised to trigger sending new document after the change.
    In addition, changing the partner will also trigger cancellation of your previous delivery order that has been received by previous partner.
